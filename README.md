In Star Killer the player will control a ship on the right side of the screen. They wil be able to speed up, slow down, and manuver up and down using the arrow keys. When the game begins a fleet of enemies will appear and begin to attack the player and move to the left of the screen. The player will have to shoot and try to destroy the enemy ships. The ships shields will be able to absorb some damage, but it will eventually fail and leave the player exposed after too much damage is taken. The player will have to wait for the shield generator to recharge. For every ship the player destroys they will gain intel and the ship will adapt to the threat better. If the player is destroyed they will lose the game and be brought back to the home screen.
